        <description>If you are a library or framework author and you wish to provid logging support to your component there are a couple of options 1) Depend on Log4Net/NLog 2) Depend on Common.Logging 3) Implement your own ILog interface and make your consumers wire it up.

Option 1 is not desirable because it forces your users to use a particular framework. Option 2 is not desirable because it will add yet more nuger package dependencies and project references with associated versioning concerns and requires wiring up with. Option 3 is desirable because it is dependency free but requires that your users to remember to write an adapter and wire things up.

This package is a version of option 3:
- It will add an ILog, ILogProvider etc to YourRootNamespace.Logging
- ILog is 2 methods to implement in comparision to Common.Logging ILog's ~65 members
- Using reflection, it transparently supports NLog and Log4Net without any wiring up required by an end user.</description>
        <summary>A source code package designed primarily for library and framework authors who want dependency free logging support in their component. Also useful in end applications. Works with .NET 4 and higher.</summary>
